## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge proved me to be not too easy since I was a bit unsure how to achieve the desktop layout of the text in the center of the two images, then I decided that I can try using ```position: relative``` on the hero content and then use the following property ```top``` with a negated value which achieved the layout seen in the hero section. Secondly for the grid of the four images I used a bit of margin coupled with a bit of height to achieve the layout seen on the desktop.


### Continued development

My plan for continued development is to attempt more frontend mentor challenges in order to better my ability of eye-balling designs and getting it close enough using css properties.
